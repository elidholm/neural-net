# Neural-Neto

## Neural Network from Scratch in Rust
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from
scratch using Rust, with minimal reliance on external packages. The
goal is to provide a clear and educational example of how neural
networks operate at a fundamental level, offering insights into both
neural network theory and Rust programming.

### Features
- **Pure Rust Implementation:** Built using Rust's standard library,
  avoiding heavy dependencies to external libraries and packages.
- **Educational:** Designed to help me understand the inner workings
  of neural networks and how they can be implemented from the ground
  up.
- **Extensible:** The codebase is structured to allow easy extension
  and experimentation with different network architectures and learning
  algorithms.
